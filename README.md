Beer brewing controller software for Raspberry Pi with Node.js

The Raspberry pi will run a Node.js webserver to allow remote control of the brewing system.  The software can be configured to support heating elements, temperature sensors, pumps, valve actuation, tank level indication, and flow rate sensors.
